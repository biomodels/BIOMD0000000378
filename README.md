**Abstract:**   
The extracellular calcium concentration has interesting effects on bursting of
pancreatic beta-cells. The mechanism underlying the extracellular Ca2+ effect
is not well understood. By incorporating a low-threshold transient inward
current to the store-operated bursting model of Chay, this paper elucidates
the role of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration in influencing electrical
activity, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and the luminal Ca2+ concentration
in the intracellular Ca2+ store. The possibility that this inward current is a
carbachol-sensitive and TTX-insensitive Na+ current discovered by others is
discussed. In addition, this paper explains how these three variables respond
when various pharmacological agents are applied to the store-operated model.
